✅ CAPSTONE PROJECT SUBMISSION: ALX Project Nexus1. Project Overview & ContextProject Name: ALX Project NexusProgram: ALX ProDev Frontend & Backend EngineeringMentor/Reviewer: [Name of Reviewer]Submission Date: [Date]Deployed URL (Live Demo): [Link to live frontend deployment]Deployed API URL: [Link to live API deployment (e.g., on Render/Vercel)]GitHub Repository: [Link to this repository]2. Key Features ImplementedProduct Catalog: Browse, filter, sort, and paginate products.Product Search: Real-time search functionality on the API.Detailed Views: Single product view with complete information.Responsive Design: Fully functional and aesthetically pleasing on mobile and desktop devices.Robust API: Handled by Django REST Framework with secure, performant endpoints.Containerization: Full Docker setup for consistent development and deployment environments.3. Technology Stack JustificationLayerTechnologyJustificationBackendPython, Django, DRFChosen for rapid development, security features, and robust ORM. DRF provides powerful serialization for building scalable APIs.DatabasePostgreSQLSelected for reliability, ACID compliance, and advanced querying features over SQLite for a production environment.FrontendReact, TypeScript, ViteModern, high-performance stack. TypeScript for strong type checking and maintainability. Vite for fast development and build times.StylingTailwind CSSUtility-first framework for rapid, responsive, and maintainable styling without writing custom CSS classes.ContainerizationDockerEnsures dependency isolation and environment parity between development, testing, and production.4. Key Challenges & SolutionsChallengeSolution ImplementedCORS/SecurityConfigured django-cors-headers explicitly in settings.py to allow the frontend origin(s) and enforce necessary headers.Initial PerformanceImplemented database query optimization (e.g., select_related, prefetch_related) and added caching for common catalog queries.Docker NetworkingUsed a docker-compose.yml file to set up a dedicated bridge network, allowing the Django service to communicate directly with the PostgreSQL service via their service names (e.g., db).5. Instructions for ReviewerSetup/Local Run: Refer to the main README.md for Docker setup instructions.Review Focus: Please pay special attention to the use of:TypeScript for type safety in frontend/.DRF Serializers/ViewSets in backend/catalog/.RTK Query for data fetching and caching in frontend/src/app/api/api.ts.Thank you for taking the time to review my capstone project.
