✅ CAPSTONE PROJECT SUBMISSION: ALX Project Nexus

1. Project Overview & Context

Project Name: ALX Project Nexus

Program: ALX ProDev Frontend & Backend Engineering

Mentor/Reviewer: [Name of Reviewer]

Submission Date: [Date]

Deployed URL (Live Demo): [Link to live frontend deployment]

Deployed API URL: [Link to live API deployment (e.g., on Render/Vercel)]

GitHub Repository: [Link to this repository]

2. Key Features Implemented

Product Catalog: Browse, filter, sort, and paginate products.

Product Search: Real-time search functionality on the API.

Detailed Views: Single product view with complete information.

Responsive Design: Fully functional and aesthetically pleasing on mobile and desktop devices.

Robust API: Handled by Django REST Framework with secure, performant endpoints.

Containerization: Full Docker setup for consistent development and deployment environments.

3. Technology Stack Justification

Layer

Technology

Justification

Backend

Python, Django, DRF

Chosen for rapid development, security features, and robust ORM. DRF provides powerful serialization for building scalable APIs.

Database

PostgreSQL

Selected for reliability, ACID compliance, and advanced querying features over SQLite for a production environment.

Frontend

React, TypeScript, Vite

Modern, high-performance stack. TypeScript for strong type checking and maintainability. Vite for fast development and build times.

Styling

Tailwind CSS

Utility-first framework for rapid, responsive, and maintainable styling without writing custom CSS classes.

Containerization

Docker

Ensures dependency isolation and environment parity between development, testing, and production.

4. Key Challenges & Solutions

Challenge

Solution Implemented

CORS/Security

Configured django-cors-headers explicitly in settings.py to allow the frontend origin(s) and enforce necessary headers.

Initial Performance

Implemented database query optimization (e.g., select_related, prefetch_related) and added caching for common catalog queries.

Docker Networking

Used a docker-compose.yml file to set up a dedicated bridge network, allowing the Django service to communicate directly with the PostgreSQL service via their service names (e.g., db).

5. Instructions for Reviewer

Setup/Local Run: Refer to the main README.md for Docker setup instructions.

Review Focus: Please pay special attention to the use of:

TypeScript for type safety in frontend/.

DRF Serializers/ViewSets in backend/catalog/.

RTK Query for data fetching and caching in frontend/src/app/api/api.ts.

Thank you for taking the time to review my capstone project.
